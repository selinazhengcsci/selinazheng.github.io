<p> For our project, my group chose to study Brooklyn. I am specifically analyzing the neighborhood of Sunset Park, with the zip code 11220. S
  unset Park is a cultural hotspot with a population of 34.8% Asian, 3.9% Black, 35.6% Hispanic, and 23.7% white in 2019. 
  It has a broad spectrum of residents across education levels (with most holding less than a high school diploma), gender (an almost even split), 
  and age (21% of residents are 25-34 years old). 21.4% of households lie within the $100,001 - $250,000 range, the largest group. 
  The median income was $71,320 and Sunset Park has a poverty rate of 18.1%, slightly higher than the city’s average of 16%. 
  Serious crime rates are lower than the city’s on average with 9.5 per every 1,000 residents as opposed to 12.2 per every 1000 residents.
  Homeownership was 30.7%, lower than the citywide share of 31.9%, but is gradually increasing, having gone up by 3.9% since 2010. </p>
