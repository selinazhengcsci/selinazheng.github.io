  <h3> Sunset Park Demographics </h3>
  <p> For our project, my group chose to study Brooklyn. I am specifically analyzing the neighborhood of Sunset Park, with the zip code 11220. S
    unset Park is a cultural hotspot with a population of 34.8% Asian, 3.9% Black, 35.6% Hispanic, and 23.7% white in 2019. 
    It has a broad spectrum of residents across education levels (with most holding less than a high school diploma), gender (an almost even split), 
    and age (21% of residents are 25-34 years old). 21.4% of households lie within the $100,001 - $250,000 range, the largest group. 
    The median income was $71,320 and Sunset Park has a poverty rate of 18.1%, slightly higher than the city’s average of 16%. 
    Serious crime rates are lower than the city’s on average with 9.5 per every 1,000 residents as opposed to 12.2 per every 1000 residents.
    Homeownership was 30.7%, lower than the citywide share of 31.9%, but is gradually increasing, having gone up by 3.9% since 2010. </p>   
  <h3> Neighborhood Rankings </h3>
  <p> According to Niche’s “commute” category (which we are using as a metric for walkability / access to public transit), Prospect Heights (A-) and 
    Sunset Park (A-) are tied for first, followed by Sheepshead Bay (B+) and then Brownsville (B). Sheepshead Bay, Sunset Park, and 
    Prospect Heights all rank at “C-” in cost of living, with Brownsville slightly ahead at C. Prospect Heights and Brownsville proved to be nearly 
    equal in this category, despite Prospect Heights being one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in NYC and Brownsville being the “poorest.” 
    Comparing Prospect Heights’ median household income to median rent prices, Niche presents a $100,568 to $2,020 ratio, while Brownsville’s is 
    $33,380 to $947. Though the income to rent ratio may make the “cost of living” ranking for these neighborhoods seem identical, residents’ quality of 
    life varies based on their proximity to public transit, education, and neighborhood politics. Prospect Heights (B-) would also be deemed the safest of 
    our four neighborhoods, followed by Sheepshead Bay (C+), Sunset Park (C), and Brownsville (C-). </p> 
  <h3> Data Analysis </h3>
  <h4>Map of Sunset Park</h4>
  <img src= "Highlighted_Map.png" alt = "Sunset Park Map" class="map">
  <p> The result is that Sunset Park makes up approximately 1.53% of Brooklyn's total affordable housing. This determines that Extremely Low Income 
    Units make up 74% of Sunset Park's total units, Very Low Income Units are 6.41%, Low Income Units are 9.31%, Moderate Income Units are 7.86%, Middle 
    Income Units are 1.45%, and Other Income Units are 0.97%.This aligns with HC2 and HC3, which found that Sunset Park was below average in cost of living. 
    However, this data is more drastic than HC2 and HC3 suggested, as most units are extremely low income, but HC2 and HC3 suggest that Sunset Park has only 
    a slightly higher poverty rate than the rest of the city and is middling in terms of income. This discrepency could be accounted for by changes in data 
    over the years. This determines that, of all of Sunset Park's affordable housing units, 12.21% are studio units, 50.54% are 1-bedroom units, 29.87% are 
    2-bedroom units, 7.38% are 3-bedroom units, and 0% consist of any other unit type. It finds that 99.76% of units are rented and 0.24% are owned by 
    residents. </p>
